universal tax calculation javascript library

Library Architecture
--------------------

It's desinged with plugin mechanisum and minimalist in mind. By default:

```
const taxer = new Taxer();
taxer.use(taxMiddlewareFn);
taxer.calc(countryCode, income, options);
```

in which:

taxMiddlewareFn should be a function accept (income, options) and return taxResult.
Moroever, taxMiddlewareFn should have a required function property `supports` that returns a boolean value.
If it's true, taxResult will be processed by that tax middleware.
The taxResult will be returned from the first supported tax middleware.
If no supported tax middleware, an Error will be thrown.

For example:

```
function vnTax() {
    return function vnTaxCalculate(income, options) {
        return results;
    };

    //return true to support otherwise, this tax middleware should be ignored
    vnTax.suports = function vnTaxSuports(countryCode, income, options) {
        return ['vn', 'vietnam'].indexOf(countryCode.toLowerCase()) > - 1;
    };
};
```

That's how the library architecture works.


How to use
----------

1. Configure

1.1. From the default taxer with built-in tax middles:

```
const taxer = builtInTaxer();
// add more custom tax middleware function
taxer.use(customTaxMiddlewareFn);
```

1.2. From scratch

```
const taxer = new Taxer();
taxer.use(vnTax());
taxer.use(usaTax());
taxer.use(sgTax());
taxer.use(customTax());
``` 

2. Use

```
const results = taxer.calculate(countryCode, income, options);
console.log(results);
```


How to develop
--------------

This is the minimalist plugin architecture inspired by express.js and koa.js a lot.
Let's keep it as minimal and lightweight as possible.

How to contribute
-----------------

By writing custom tax plugins to create a good solid universal tax system in the world.
